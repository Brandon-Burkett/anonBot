# Anon Bot

A Discord bot used to allow students to ask questions semi-anonymously.

## Motivation

Created for a Bucknell University computer science course. The goal was to create a bot that would allow students to ask questions in a discord channel without revealing their identity to their classmates. The bot would then post the question to a separate channel where the professor could see identites to allow moderation.
